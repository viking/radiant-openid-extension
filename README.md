Open ID extension for Radiant
=============================

This extension adds Open ID support to Radiant 0.8.2.  This relies on (as yet) unreleased features in the [0.8.2 branch](http://github.com/radiant/radiant/tree/0.8.2).

### Available Settings ###

* **openid.override**: set to "true" in order to use Open ID as the sole login method
* **openid.autoauth**: set to an OP url in order to automatically initiate Open ID login
